User Story
 I recently joined a fitness group where we are accountable buddies for our daily food intake.  We send pictures of our breakfast, lunch, and dinner and exchange different recipes to help us reach our fitness goals. No one is on a specific diet say to say you can’t eat this or that, but that we stay within a certain nutritional range depending on our individual goals. Some guys in the group have expressed that it can be difficult to determine the nutritional value of each item they in-guest Dailey. Nutra Fetch helps streamline meal prep by fetching Nutritional Information on the go.
